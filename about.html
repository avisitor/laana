           <h2>About Laʻana!</h2>
              <div style="font-size: 18px;">
                <p>Laʻana is a tool for learners of Hawaiian to search example sentences. Our goal is to allow learners to see how words are used in context, similar to <a href="https://tatoeba.org/en/" target="_blank">The Tatoeba Project.</a> This is useful for things like adding sentences to flashcards, or just seeing more context to better understand a word.</p>
                <p>This project also serves a secondary purpose of being the first Hawaiian sentence corpus. This means that we can eventually begin collecting some interesting data on things like word frequency and common search terms.</p>
                <p>Laʻana! is a pet project by <a href="https://github.com/MeijiIshinIsLame" target="_blank">Zachary Silva</a>. I don't know why I am compelled to use the word "we" since I am the only person working on this. I am not making any money on this project. This was simply made for fun and because I have an interest in prepetuating the Hawaiian language.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, please email <b>laanadev@gmail.com</b>. Any advice or criticism is appreciated.</p>
