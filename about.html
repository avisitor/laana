              <div>
                <p>Noiʻiʻōlelo is a tool for learners of Hawaiian to search for sample sentences
                  using a word or words and for those seeking to understand Hawaiian language patterns.
                  It includes a database of sentences as well as a database of the full text of a large
                  number of historical and current Hawaiian language documents. It
                  is inspired by the <a href="https://laana.org">Laana</a> website of Zachary Silva.</p>
                <p>Besides simple word searches, Noiʻiʻōlelo supports regular expression searches for
                  complex patterns across a large number of historical and current documents. Our hope
                  is that it will be useful for research into past and current Hawaiian grammar and
                lexical usage.</p>
